The title of our project is Rapid prototyping of device using QEMU.The goal of our project is to develop a virtual device and test it without using hardware components,Objective is to test a device withuot buying it and knowing about the device.
For this we used Quick Emulator tool for virtual device emulation and buildroot used to generate of a linux image these are the two tools used to generate our device.
We are searching for lots of platform and choose the Quick Emulator platform for device emulation,Beacuase we are thinking that the platform is suited for our requirements.And we are worked on that and emulate an device on it.
And for the generating linux image we are choosing the buildroot.And YECTO platform are also there but the problem of the YECTO is is an time limit process.That why we are choosing the buildroot platform to generating an linux image.And it is easy to understand and it is user friendly .
